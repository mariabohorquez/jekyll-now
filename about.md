I'm studying Electronics Engineering at Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela. I love learning new things, now I want to write about applying them.

### My interests:


- DevOps: creating secure systems and managing them is my current goal. I will be mainly writing about this.

- Machine Learning: I completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course in 2015 while waiting to start university. It taught me the basics of ML algorithms and programming in Matlab.

- Networking: that same year I started Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching modules. I choose to go the CCNA Security route when I discovered my hidden love for network hacking.

- Arch Linux distro: it took me around two weeks and several hours in forums but I have got my system to my liking. This is a great OS if you like personalizing your computer to the most minumun detail. I know how to write bash scripts now.

- Robotics: I haven't had the change to build something big but I started stuying electronics because I wanted to create robots to solve all kinds of problems. Linux moves all IoT hardware.

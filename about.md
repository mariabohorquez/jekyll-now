I'm studying Electronics Engineering at Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela. I made this blog to share what I'm learning while studying for the Cisco CCNA Security certification and to share stuff about the many hobbies I have.

### My interests:

* Machine Learning: I completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course in 2015 while waiting to start university. This is a very basic course but it taught me the basics of ML algorithms and programming in Matlab.

* Networking: That same year I started Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching modules. I choose to go the CCNA Security route instead of finishing them when I discovered my hidden love for network hacking.

* Arch Linux distro: it took me around two weeks and several hours in forums but I have got my system to my liking. This is a great OS if you like personalizing your computer to the most minumun detail. I know how to write linux scripts because of this baby too.

* Robotics: I haven't had the change to build something big but I started stuying electronics because I wanted to create robots to solve all kinds of problems.

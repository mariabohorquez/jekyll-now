### I have been accepted in Google Summer of Code by Robocomp

  I proposed two projects towards their organization on the basis that I really like the framework and their social robots. I want to help them grow, reach more users and be more beginner-friendly. 
  
  As of today I'll start working on the project "Generation of new use cases, tutorials and reference information for RoboComp".
  
  For the first month of coding I have the following objetives:
  
  1. Implementing new tutorials in the area of Installation Guides for Windows and various Linux distros (mainly Fedora and Arch Linux).
    - Making a guide on how to use Ubuntu in Windows either via virtual machine or the Unix subsystem of Windows 10.
    - Figuring out how to install Robocomp in Arch Linux and Fedora. There are several possible ways:
      - Making a local branch with Ice 3.7 and a different installation guide (this is already partly done by another [GSoC project](https://github.com/lovemehta/RoboComp-JS) from a past year). This could possibly help future projects.
      - Making a tutorial about how to download Ice 3.5 from source.
      - Migrate the master branch to Ice 3.7 and install Ice 3.7 in Ubuntu. Installing is relatively easy, this is [how](https://zeroc.com/downloads/ice). The difficult part would be to migrate all Robocomp to Ice 3.7. On the other side it's becoming necessary.
  2. Improve the github page. Look for errors and start moving and rewriting stuff.
  3. Create a Contribute.md page and a pull request template to make it easier to contribute in an orderly way.
  4. Write a new About Page. This needs to be done with a lot of time to review it until ot conveys the "Why --> How --> What" of Robocomp perfectly.
  
  I should also use this time to look for the best tutorials to do first so my work on the second month is more planned. This will be done by contacting members of Robocomp and asking about projects they have done.
  
  **Note:** Migrating Robocomp to Ice 3.7 could be beneficial. I need to speak about it with my mentor and Pablo Bustos to see how practical would it really be.

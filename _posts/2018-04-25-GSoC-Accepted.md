## I have been accepted in Google Summer of Code by Robocomp

  I proposed two projects towards their organization on the basis that I really like the framework and their social robots. I want to hep them grow, reach more users and be more beginner-friendly. 
  
  As of today I'll start working on the project "Generation of new use cases, tutorials and reference information for RoboComp".
  
  For the first month of coding I have the following objetives:
  
  1. Implementing new tutorials in the area of Installation Guides for Windows and various Linux distros (mainly Fedora and Arch Linux).
  ⋅⋅* Making a guide on how to use Ubuntu in Windows either via virtual machine or the unix subsystem of Windows 10.
  ⋅⋅* Figuring out how to install Robocomp in Arch Linux and Fedora. There are several possible ways:
  ⋅⋅⋅* Making a local branch with Ice 3.7 and a different installation guide (this is already partly done by another GSoC project from a past year)

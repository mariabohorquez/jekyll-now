title: My Arch Linux setup
---

I'm going to explain how I installed Arch Linux in one of the partitions of my laptop, in dual boot with a Windows partition (that I honestly don't use anymore).


Things you'll need:
⋅⋅* An usb that you can format. Any you have should work. I used the Anarchy Linux* installer, that weighs around 500MB.
⋅⋅* An Internet connection of any speed. 
⋅⋅* At least curiosity towards an OS where you can costumize everything. 



*Formely called Arch Anywhere.

## Contributing

GitHub recognizes a special file in the repository called the CONTRIBUTING file. If you have a file named CONTRIBUTING with any file extension, GitHub will show Opening a Pull Request when a CONTRIBUTING file exists. when anyone starts opening a Pull Request.

We will make one for the highlyunstable branch called 'CONTRIBUTING.md'. We'll make one taking [this](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) one as reference.

This will serve as a guideline about how to contribute in an easy and orderly manner to Robocomp.
